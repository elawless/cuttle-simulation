ANALYSIS: Why Opus Succeeds Where Others Fail
================================================================================

1. CARD ADVANTAGE UNDERSTANDING
   - Uses 5 one-off (draw 2) - gets more cards
   - Uses 3 one-off (revive) to recover key cards
   - Understands that card count matters

2. KING STRATEGY
   - Plays Kings to reduce threshold
   - Also destroys opponent's Kings with 2 one-off
   - Understands threshold manipulation

3. JACK BATTLES
   - Aggressively contests stolen points
   - Uses Jacks to swing point totals
   - Doesn't let opponent keep stolen cards

4. TACTICAL RESETS
   - Uses Ace one-off when significantly behind
   - But not randomly - only when it helps

5. COUNTER DISCIPLINE
   - Knows when to counter vs decline
   - Doesn't waste 2s on unimportant effects

KEY INSIGHT:
Opus seems to understand the meta-game better than the heuristic.
While the heuristic follows "play high points fast", Opus plays
more dynamically - disrupting opponent's strategy while building
its own position.

The simple heuristic doesn't account for:
- Card advantage (having more options)
- Threshold manipulation (Kings)
- Point denial (Jacks, scuttling key cards)
- Board resets when behind

Opus implicitly understands these higher-level concepts.
