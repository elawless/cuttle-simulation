ANALYSIS
================================================================================

SONNET'S GOOD MOVES:
- Uses 7 one-off (play from deck) - only good one-off
- Plays Kings consistently
- Plays high point cards when available
- Uses Jacks to steal

SONNET'S BAD MOVES (per 100k analysis):
- 9 one-off (return permanent): 41.2% win rate - used 4 times
- 8 as Glasses: 41.8% win rate - used 3 times
- Ace one-off: 43.8% win rate - used 4 times
- Queens: 42.6% win rate - used 4 times
- Scuttling: 47.5% win rate - frequent

KEY INSIGHT:
Even Claude Sonnet doesn't fully understand the optimal strategy.
The simple heuristic of "play high points fast, avoid one-offs"
beats sophisticated reasoning 75% of the time.

COMPARISON:
- Random vs Heuristic: Heuristic wins 78.6%
- Haiku vs Heuristic: Heuristic wins 100% (4-0)
- Sonnet vs Heuristic: Heuristic wins 75% (6-2)

Sonnet is roughly as good as playing randomly with slight improvements.
