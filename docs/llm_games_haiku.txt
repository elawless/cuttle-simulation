================================================================================
ANALYSIS: Claude Haiku's Mistakes
================================================================================

BAD MOVES MADE BY CLAUDE (per 100k game analysis):
- 8 as Glasses: 5 times (41.8% win rate move)
- Ace as one-off: 4 times (43.8% win rate move)
- Queens: 4 times (42.6% win rate move)
- Scuttling: 8 times (47.5% win rate move)
- 3 as one-off (revive): 4 times (43.0% win rate move)
- 6 as one-off: 2 times (42.3% win rate move)
- 9 as one-off: 1 time (41.2% win rate move)

GOOD MOVES MADE BY CLAUDE:
- Jacks to steal points: 5 times (63.9% win rate move)
- Kings: 4 times (59.3% win rate move)
- High point cards: Several times

CONCLUSION:
Claude Haiku plays too defensively and uses one-offs excessively.
The simple heuristic of "play high points fast" dominates.
